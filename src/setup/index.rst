Installing mkite
================

The installation of mkite can be a minimal installation (for the case of clients) or complete installation, where the requirements of the server will be set up. In general, to install mkite, we will need to:

1. Prepare a Python environment
2. Install basic mkite packages
3. Set up a PostgreSQL database
4. Set up an mkite engine (e.g., Redis or filesystem)

In this tutorial, we will walk through this installation process.
Later, we will learn how to configure and setup these mkite servers and clients.
